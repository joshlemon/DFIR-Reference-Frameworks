# DFIR Reference Frameworks
This repository is intended to provide a public reference to frameworks directly relevant to the DFIR community. It's common for the DFIR community to use terminology that isn't always well defined in the documentation they produce. This repository aims to help the DFIR community, and those reading information from the DFIR community, have a better understanding of defined terms and a more consistent approach to the language used in documentation.
